# Why I start this blog?
- Got married this year and began thinking about finance and leaving something for my kids
- Learn about finance and share my knowledge
- There's a lot of information out there, there are people trying to sell you a course but I don't have a course to sell to you, I will share my knowledge for free
- Achieving financial freedom isn't about being rich. It's a necessity. You'll never know if you will ever be fired when you in your 50s. You wouldn't want to be begging for a job then.
