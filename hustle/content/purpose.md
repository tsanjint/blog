# Why I start this blog?
How to make $10,000 a month is not what this blog is about. School never taught us much about managing our money, doing our taxes or planning for financial freedom.

Through this blog, I want to share with you what I have learnt about personal finance, budgeting for family, insurance policy to protect you and your family, saving for taxes, investing for beginners, estate planning and achieving financial freedom. 

We live in an age with a plethora of information and everyone is trying to sell us a course. I won't have a course to sell you, but I will be sharing the results of what I have learnt. I hope you will find this useful.
